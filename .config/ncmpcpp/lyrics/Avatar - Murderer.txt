Once there was little girl
Visiting a little boy
Stayed up watching late night shows
No one else was home

Once upon a time below
Stangers' faces pale and old
Misery and broken bones
Set the stage

Are you sacred of what you might like?
Are you scared you'll get out alive?
Hear the wind blow and church bells chime
Hear the mob that awaits outside

Shame on you who dared survive
You shall pay
The dead will rise

Murderer
Murderer
Tiny children small no more
Voice their anger:
"Burn the whore!"
Murderer

Will the torturer save your soul?
Will this path take you down below?
Speak the truth, there's no need to fear
Speak the truth that they want to hear

Shame on you who dared survive
You shall pay
The dead will rise

Murderer
Murderer
Tiny children small no more
Voice their anger:
"Burn the whore!"
Murderer

Innocence
Innocence, you have to sink
Innocence
Return from the devil
Release us from hell

Shame on you who dared survive
You shall pay when dead will rise
Pain and torture waits below
Thank these men who made you go

Murderer
Murderer
Tiny children small no more
Voice their anger:
"Burn the whore!"
Murderer

Murderer
Murderer
Murderer

Murderer
Murderer
Tiny children small no more
Voice their anger:
"Burn the whore!"
Murderer
