How can I sleep
When everyone else turns to dust, how can I breathe.
When my mouth is filled with their ashes
Another day lost trying to exit the program,
I've seen enough
To feed a psychosis for a lifetime

Bloody angel!

When did it start
This force is too strong to resist
Where is too far
All I did was try to save them
Haunted by screams
Chasing me back to my childhood, I cannot flee
I've got tormentoures for a lifetime

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains, and look what I've found in the dirt
Pale battered body, seems like she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

Bloody angel!

All that I know
I'm willing to give it away
All that I love
Disappeared like sand in the ocean
Remember the lives
Lost within withering pages, trying to hide
But I see tragedy through a lifetime.
Bloody angel!

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains, and look what I found in the dirt.
Pale battered body, seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

Fierce bloody angel
The blood is on your hands, why did you come to this world.

Everybody turns to dust
Everybody turns to dust
Everybody turns to dust
Everybody turns to dust

The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains, and look what I found in the dirt.
Pale battered body, seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

Bloody angel!

Bloody angel!
