All orders to surrender are false
Eye on the target
Back to the wall
Your body's shaking
The mountain's too tall
You want to lie down and rest on Elysian fields
Carry you home, upon your shield

A mighty Spartan
You answer to none
You're on a field trip and hell sounds like fun
You know that
The path is dirty to fortune and fame
You're sworn and ready to go down in flames

All orders to surrender are false!
All messages fabricated!
Our goal is the gate of the castle!
Unleash hell!

Vultures fly
And we'll make it worse
Drowning out the light
Out of sight
It's just like a curse
Drowning out the light

You're God's own soldier
The lost and found son
War is your calling
It has to be won
You want to show your daddy
You're all grown up and strong
But the journey proved to be too long

Vultures fly
And we'll make it worse
Drowning out the light
Out of sight
It's just like a curse
Drowning out the light

Eyes on the target
Back to the wall
You motherfucker you are killing us all

Vultures fly
And we'll make it worse
Drowning out the light
Out of sight
It's just like a curse
Drowning out the light
