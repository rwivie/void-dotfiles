I don't know
What I don't know [x3]

There's hellfire in the chalice
Let your lips touch ground and drink
Sister dearest
Sick of love
Don't you know?

I've been promised no salvation
Just a lonely bitter end
For the while I'll spare our lives
Promise me

I don't know
What I don't know [x3]

I'm the worm inside the bottle
And the fairies gone astray
In this forest creatures dwell
Let me out

I don't know
What I don't know [x3]
I don't know
What I don't know [x3]

I don't know
What I don't know [x3]
I don't know
What I don't know [x3]
I don't know
What I don't know [x3]
I don't know
What I don't know [x3]
