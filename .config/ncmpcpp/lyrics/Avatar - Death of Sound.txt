Welcome to the wasteland
The universe between
Dive into the darkness and see the end and oblivion
Entropy

Sinking to the bottom
Lost in a giants dream
Breath the smoke of bodies set free
Read the scripture and glorify
Agony

Let the death of sound
Sing the end of time
By a promise bound
To the water
Bring me water, I'm dying

Given to the ocean
The depths will set you free
Drawn down by the current and feel
Dissolution of body parts
Make me real

Let the death of sound
Sing the end of time
By a promise bound
To the water
Bring me water, I'm dying

Welcome to the wasteland
The universe between
Dive into the darkness and see the end and oblivion
Entropy

Let the death of sound
Sing the end of time
By a promise bound
To the water
Bring me water, I'm dying
